# Form Builder Components

The form builder is the core functionality of this application, allowing users to create, edit, and manage custom forms.

## Key Components
- [components/form-builder/form-builder.tsx](mdc:components/form-builder/form-builder.tsx) - Main form builder component

## Admin Pages
- [app/(admin)/admin/forms/page.tsx](mdc:app/(admin)/admin/forms/page.tsx) - Forms listing page
- [app/(admin)/admin/forms/add/page.tsx](mdc:app/(admin)/admin/forms/add/page.tsx) - Add new form page
- [app/(admin)/admin/forms/edit/[id]/page.tsx](mdc:app/(admin)/admin/forms/edit/[id]/page.tsx) - Edit form page

## Public Pages
- [app/(public)/forms/[id]/page.tsx](mdc:app/(public)/forms/[id]/page.tsx) - Public form submission page

The form builder uses React Hook Form for form state management and validation, with Zod for schema validation.
